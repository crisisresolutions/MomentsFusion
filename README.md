**Moments Fusion is a framework for Regenerative Finance (ReFi) that aims to help individuals from all walks of life be mindfully present by fully immersing themselves in each moment economically. It is a new form of a system-agnostic economy (meta-economy) that promotes Sustainability, Resilience, and Continuity.**

Moments are the foundational principle of our approach. They represent a state of unity and economic balance. Instead of viewing moments as mere records or identities, we see them as a fusion of everything, where the observed and the observer are not separate entities. This fusion allows us to experience, express, and expand economic abundance.
